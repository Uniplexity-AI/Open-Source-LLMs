# Open-Source-LLMs Notebooks 🚀

Welcome to the **Open-Source-LLMs** repository! This project is designed to help developers, students, and AI enthusiasts prototype and experiment with **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. The notebooks provided are optimized for **fast prototyping** on platforms like **Google Colab**, making it accessible to users with small laptops or limited hardware.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository offers a collection of notebooks focused on:

- **Building Chatbot Systems**: Rapid prototyping of chatbots using LLMs.
- **LLM Fine-Tuning**: Adapting pre-trained models to specific tasks using smaller datasets.
- **Vector Databases**: Efficiently managing and retrieving high-dimensional vector data to enhance search capabilities.
- **Building LLM Agents**: Autonomous systems capable of performing tasks and interacting with users.
- **Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combining information retrieval with text generation for more accurate and contextually relevant results.

All notebooks are compatible with **Google Colab**, enabling users to quickly get started without needing a high-performance local machine.

## ✨ Features

- **Fast Prototyping**: Ready-to-use Google Colab notebooks for immediate testing and learning.
- **Easy Fine-Tuning**: Demonstrates how to fine-tune LLMs on custom datasets with minimal resources.
- **Vector Search**: Implementation of vector databases for efficient retrieval of semantic information.
- **LLM Agents**: Build autonomous agents that interact with users and perform tasks using LLMs.
- **RAG**: Explore the power of Retriever-Augmented Generation for enhancing language models with external data.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- `/notebooks`: Contains all the Colab-ready notebooks, categorized by topics such as fine-tuning, chatbot systems, vector databases, LLM agents, and RAG.
- `/data`: Sample datasets for testing and experimentation.
- `/models`: Pre-trained models and instructions on fine-tuning them.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kondwain0099/Open-Source-LLMs.git
cd Open-Source-LLMs
```

### 2. Open in Google Colab

The notebooks are designed to run on Google Colab, so you don’t need heavy computational resources. Just follow these steps:

- Navigate to the `/notebooks` folder.
- Choose the notebook you're interested in (e.g., `Chatbot_Prototype.ipynb`).
- Open the notebook in Google Colab by clicking the **Open in Colab** badge at the top of the notebook.

### 3. Run the Notebook

Simply run the cells in the notebook. If a GPU is needed, make sure to enable it by navigating to `Runtime` > `Change runtime type` > Set **Hardware accelerator** to `GPU`.
